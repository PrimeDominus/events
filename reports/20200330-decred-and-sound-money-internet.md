#### Decred presence

- @eSizeDave and @zohand functioned as hosts/facilitators of the virtual meetup, while other participants were able to speak with the group or chat via the text messaging interface. There were some in-depth discussions and input from a variety of participants, while overall @Checkmate likely had most of the mic time.

## Overview

Decred Australia's team has an exciting new addition in @checkmate who has recently moved down under. We collaborated with him to run a virtual meetup that discussed key topics such as sound money, the macroeconomic environment, gold, and Decred.

The depth of conversation was impressive and the audience found the insights shared very valuable. This has set the standard for future virtual meetups that we are planning to host in the coming months. A strong focus for the next one will be on-chain analysis for Decred and Bitcoin.

Further to this, several influencers who run major platforms such as Nuggets News and Blockchain Brad are now interested in hosting Decred Australia on their podcast. Discussion points will be very similar to the ones discussed in this virtual meetup. This has the potential to reach over 150,000 subscribers of their channels and increase their awareness of Decred and the role it plays in sound money.
