## Overview

The crypto fire alliance was put together to help in the Australia's bushfire relief efforts that ravaged many parts of nation. A series of events were held around the country and the Decred team was a participant in the Melbourne leg as a panelist and speaker.

The format of the event was an update on the markets from crypto fund Cloudbreak and an update on the state of mining by Mining Store. These were followed by a product demo from the private messaging app team Loki. The main event was a panel discussion on the topic of what is in store for crypto in 2020 and beyond.

Many questions were raised towards Decred's speaker, @eSizeDave. The crowd were very intrigued in the key topics that were brought up by David such as governance, funding and decentralized coordination of a project. These were then used as the basis for the discussion for the rest of the session which carried on for an hour. It became apparent that these were core topics that would trend and dictate the future of crypto for years to come. @eSizeDave performed well and delivered very insightful details as to how Decred is designed and how it compared to many other projects, in terms of key principles and fundamentals. He also highlighted a lot of features within Decred's design such as staking and voting. [Mining Store's William Wright](https://miningstore.com.au/) also chimed in with similar views on how a hybrid POS/POW model would inherently be a stronger design, and this brought the conversation to a special area in mining dynamics and the role miners play today in crypto and their role in the future.

On the digital marketing front, Decred Australia's [twitter video](https://twitter.com/DecredAustralia/status/1235390840307978245?s=20) post has over 850 views thus far.

The number of participants was over 80 people who were made up of key community influencers, various local crypto projects, crypto funds, individual investors, and legal and marketing service providers. It was a fantastic event for networking, and the fundraising section of the event managed to raise over \$1,000 for the bushfire relief.

This was a successful event and the Decred team benefitted greatly from the exposure.
